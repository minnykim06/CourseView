Freshman English is a year-long course that focuses on California Standards in English-Language Arts beyond middle school to develop broader and deeper understanding of more complex texts, more advanced critical thinking and inferential reading skills, and more sophisticated writing experiences. Listening and speaking builds upon the reading skills through rich class discussions of those texts and presentations that develop oral delivery and media presentation ability. Students have many opportunities to practice e\ufffdective speaking and listening skills through informal classroom discussions and formally prepared presentations. Examples of speaking applications include delivery of a narrative, research-based, argumentation, and/or expository presentations. Reading comprehension skills are strengthened through close examination of a variety of texts and genres, including the novel, short \ufb01ction, non-\ufb01ction, poetry, and drama. These standards lay the foundation for college and career readiness by guiding students toward independent close reading and comprehension of sophisticated texts of all kinds. The reading comprehension emphasis is twofold: (1) on the recognition and analysis of literary features across genres; and (2) on the analysis of organizational patterns, and positions advanced in non-\ufb01ction modes of writing. Writing standards escalate expectations of student work through practice emphasizing organization, focus, analysis, revision, research, and the appropriate application of technology.The core freshman writing experience includes response to literature, personal narrative, argumentation, and research writing, as well as smaller writing responses, both formal and informal.",

At the end of the course, students will have a portfolio of their data science work to showcase their newly developed knowledge and understanding. The curriculum will be adaptable so that teachers can either use the data sets provided or bring in data sets most relevant to their own students. This data science course will provide students with opportunities to understand the data science process of asking questions, gathering and organizing data, modeling, analyzing and synthesizing, and communicating. Students will work through this process in a variety of contexts.
